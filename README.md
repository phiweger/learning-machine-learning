# Machines are now just awesome - The MANJA seminar series.

A self-help seminar for people with mild to severe machine learning disabilities.

## Metadata

- Thursdays, 10:30 - 12ish
- "problem first"
- half theory, half practice (live coding)
- content checked into Github and curated for communal reuse
- each seminar might include:
    - slides
    - reading list, further reading
    - (mock) data and code examples
    - open questions
- guests from outside the tower welcome
- NO journal club, NO pure theory seminar
- math questions @Bashar
- repo administration @Kevin

## Practicalities

Please submit your content/ changes via pull requests.

We will mainly code in Python 3.X and make heavy use of

- [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [Keras](https://keras.io/)
